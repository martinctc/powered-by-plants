# Main prompt

I would like to create a static HTML website and host it using GitHub Pages. This is the repo for this website.
The aim of this website is to share my previous experiences of participating in Veganuary, in particular tips about how to stay motivated, eat enough so you don't feel hungry, as well as recipes, and favourite restaurants that I have identified in London and Hong Kong. 

Roughly, therefore, I have identified the following main pages: 
- Home
- Why go vegan?
- Recipes
- Tips

Please help me set up this repo and website, providing me with options to make key critical decisions in design and content. Please ask me any questions if it critically affects the design, content, or infrastructure. 

## Design

It would be great if this website is mobile-optimized (responsive), ideally with a parallax design. 

## Content

For content, you can base this on an appeal I have created and posted on social media. For the recipes, it would be a huge enhancement if we can tag them with whether they are a #main-meal or #breakfast or #chinese, or #western, etc. 

### Main message

This would be my third year doing Veganuary. 
I've completed this challenge once with friends, and once just on my own. It was definitely more fun with friends, but both times it was rewarding! 

Why go vegan for a month? 
(1) it’s one of the most impactful things you can do to save our environment 
(2) it’s a gamechanger for your heart and gut health
(3) let's reduce unnecessary suffering. If we can enjoy food that's tasty and healthy without cruelty, then why not?  

It’s just a month. And it’s easier than it sounds!

Join me this January and I’d be super happy to share tips and recipes!
